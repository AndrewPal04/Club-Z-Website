  "monthlyProgress": " Danna had a great month coming back from the break. She didn't seem to have forgotten much of the topics we covered before, which lead to an easy return to learning new topics after review. For reading/writing, Danna was great with both as she begins reading a new story. As for math, She has done a great job understanding any new topics she receives.",
